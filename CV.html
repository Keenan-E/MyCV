        <h1>Curriculum Vitae of Keenan Eriss</h1>

        <p>My name is Keenan Eriss, I grew up in Eldorado Park where I completed 
            my senior academic career at Eldorado Park Senior Secondary School.
            I was afforded the opportunity for an apprenticeship as a Motor Mechanic.
            
            I Qualified as a Motor Mechanic and obtained a red seal 
            certificate. During my time as a Motor Mechanic I spent 7 years working on
            the bench as a Technician and 2 years as a Workshop Foreman. I'm currently 
            pursuing a certificate in Python programming through
            the institution of Hyperiondev. 
            
            Due to the monotony of my previous profession I have developed a passion for 
            software development. The idea of becoming a software developer was motivated
            by the flexibility of the work-life balance and the substantial financial 
            rewards. Learning about DevOps, testing, or agile methodologies is what I would 
            most likely aspire to do.
